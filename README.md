This project came from me learning PHP, and wanting to build a website with it from the ground up. <br>
In order to run this project you will need to have docker and docker-compose installed. <br>
This docker-compose file builds the image, you can modify this to not build the image every time if you'd prefer. <br>

To start this container.
```angular2html
docker-compose up
```
If you want to not see the logs
```angular2html
docker-compose up -d
```
Submit any issues you find if you would like. <br>
This is an "as I can" type of project where I make bug fixes as I am able to.
